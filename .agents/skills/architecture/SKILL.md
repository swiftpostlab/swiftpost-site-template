# Architecture

## Purpose

Define the high-level architectural rules for the repo: how code is organized, how components are composed, how client/server boundaries work, how features stay isolated, and where files go.

For the Elysium UI library reference (components, props, imports, styling), see the **styling** skill.
For TypeScript/React coding patterns, see the **code-conventions** skill.
For Next.js-specific constraints and page patterns, see the **next** skill.

## When to use this skill

- Designing a new feature or component hierarchy.
- Deciding where business logic vs. presentation belongs.
- Understanding where to place new code.
- Setting up a new feature module.
- Navigating the monorepo layout.
- Reviewing modularity and separation of concerns.

## Monorepo Overview

**Turborepo** with **Yarn workspaces**. Three packages:

| Package | Path | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| `@swiftpost/config` | `packages/config/` | Shared ESLint and TypeScript configs |
| `@swiftpost/elysium` | `packages/elysium/` | Internal UI library — thin MUI 7 wrappers + enhanced components |
| `@swiftpost/main` | `packages/main/` | Next.js 15 app (static export, App Router, Turbopack) |

```

## Modularity & Feature Isolation

Fat components are strictly banned. UI components must be presentation-focused.

* **The `features` Directory:** Domain-specific logic (e.g., `storage`, `auth`, `data-processing`) must be encapsulated within `packages/main/src/features/{feature-name}/`. Expose hooks, types, and constants from here. Do not leak business logic into `src/components`.
* **Component Splitting:** Extract complex UI states (e.g., Authenticated vs. Unauthenticated views) into private, sibling components within the same file to keep the main render method clean and readable.
* **No cross-feature imports:** Features must not import from other features. Shared logic goes in `src/components/` (presentation) or a shared utility.

## Feature-First Architecture

Domain logic lives in `packages/main/src/features/<feature-name>/`. Features are self-contained modules that encapsulate their own types, hooks, components, services, and utilities.

### Feature Structure

```
features/<feature-name>/
├── index.ts              # Barrel — re-exports the feature's public API
├── types.ts              # Zod schemas + inferred TS types
├── constants.ts          # Config values, defaults
├── hooks/
│   ├── index.ts          # Barrel for hooks
│   ├── useFeatureData.ts
│   └── useFeatureState.ts
├── components/
│   ├── index.ts          # Barrel for components
│   ├── FeatureDashboard.tsx
│   └── FeatureCard.tsx
├── services/
│   └── featureService.ts # Plain object singletons with async methods
└── utils/
    └── formatters.ts     # Feature-specific helpers
```

### Feature Rules

- **Barrel files:** Every feature root and major subfolder has an `index.ts` that re-exports the public API.
- **Self-contained:** Features must not import from other features. Shared logic goes in `src/components/` or a shared utility.
- **No business logic in components:** `src/components/` is presentation-only. Domain logic stays in `src/features/`.
- **Services are plain objects:** Use object singletons with async methods, not classes.
- **Zod for domain models:** Define schemas in `types.ts`, derive TS types with `z.infer<>`.

## Composition Guidelines

* **Presentation vs. Logic:** Components in `src/components/` are presentation-only shells. They receive data via props and render UI. All data fetching, state management, and business logic belongs in `src/features/`.
* **Hook Encapsulation:** Domain logic exposed to components should be wrapped in custom hooks that live in `src/features/{feature}/hooks/`. Components consume these hooks — they don't implement the logic inline.
* **Barrel Exports:** Every feature root and major subfolder has an `index.ts` that re-exports the public API. Consumers import from the barrel, not from internal files.

## Reusable Component Architecture

Reusable components that are meant to be flexible and overridable must use the **MUI 7 Slots & SlotProps** pattern. See the **styling** skill for the full pattern reference and examples.

Key rules:
* Define `SlotProps` for internal elements, `Props` with `slots?`, `slotProps`, and `sx?`.
* Never overwrite `sx` — always merge with `spreadSx`.
* Use `const componentBaseName` (kebab-case) for CSS class targeting.
* Wrap reusable UI components in `memo`.

## Import Rules

Do not guess import paths. Adhere strictly to these conventions:

| What | Import From |
|------|-------------|
| MUI base components | `@swiftpost/elysium/ui/base/{ComponentName}` |
| Enhanced components (Link, Image, etc.) | `@swiftpost/elysium/ui/{ComponentName}` |
| MUI Icons | `@mui/icons-material` |
| Shared layout components | `@/components/{ComponentName}` |
| Feature modules | `@/features/{feature-name}` or `@/features/{feature-name}/{subpath}` |
| Theme values (SSR-safe) | `@/styles/staticTheme` |
| Links/Navigation | `@swiftpost/elysium/ui/Link` (never `next/link` directly) |

## Tooling Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `yarn dev` | Start Next.js dev server (Turbopack) |
| `yarn build` | Production build (static export) |
| `yarn lint` | ESLint check (all packages via Turbo) |
| `yarn lint:fix` | Auto-fix lint issues |

## File Placement Guide

| Scenario | Where | Why |
|----------|-------|-----|
| New domain feature | `src/features/<name>/` | Feature-first isolation |
| Shared layout component | `src/components/` | Presentation-only, cross-feature |
| New route/page | `src/app/<route>/page.tsx` + `ClientWrapper.tsx` | App Router convention |
| Page template | `src/templates/` | Reusable page layouts |
| Theme config | `src/styles/` | Centralized theming |
| Cross-feature types | `src/types.ts` | Only if genuinely shared |
| Feature-specific types | `src/features/<name>/types.ts` | Keep close to usage |
